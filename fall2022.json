Capably wielding a sword longer than his own height, Guts defeats mighty foes with ease.\nThe one who sets his sights on Guts is Griffith, leader of the Band of the Hawk mercenaries. With ambition buried deep down, and far more leadership ability than his beauty would suggest, Griffith gets the better of Guts in a duel, thus drawing him into the Band of the Hawk. Over the course of numerous hard-fought battles, the comrades all form bonds of trust with one another. The ties between Griffith and Guts in particular grow to become something special.\nEventually the Band of the Hawk joins the ranks of the kingdom of Midland's regular army, but this is nothing more than the first step in Griffith's grand designs. Meanwhile, Guts begins to harbor doubts about a life spent just wielding his sword as a part of Griffith's dream. But little does he suspect the dreadful fate that endless dream has bestowed upon them both.[Source: Crunchyroll]",

Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults.[Source: AniDB]",
