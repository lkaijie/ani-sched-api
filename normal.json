However, for the 99th sacrifice, the human girl brought to the capital, Sariphi, intrigues the Beast King. In fact she isn't afraid of him or any other beast and even accepts her death without begging or crying as she has neither home nor family to return to if she were released. The King finds her intriguing and let her stay at his side as his consort despite being human. This is the story of how Sariphi will become the queen of the demons and beasts.[Source: Crunchyroll]",

Kenji Nishiki, who had quit the team in a dispute with its manager while in the middle grade years, returns to the team as well, and the team carries on with newly joined members.\nThe following spring, Otomi Tachibana, Ichiban Natsuno, Arisa Mita, and Ryo Akai enter the high school. Ichiban aspires to be a pitcher. Arisa is the younger sister of Hiroki Mita, and Ryo is the younger brother of Tomohito Akai. Tomohito reveals to Toma how he and Ryo are brothers by remarriage just like Toma and Soichiro are, that their relationship is discordant due to troubles in the past, and that Ryo, who had quit baseball feeling inferior to Tomohito, still loves the sport and has a talent for it. Tomohito asks Toma to persuade Ryo to join the team by using him as the \u201cbad guy\u201d, and Toma obliges. The baseball team begins its new season with new members including Ichiban and Ryo.\nThe Eastern Tokyo block preliminaries begin for the summer national tournament, and the Meisei High School team advances steadily. Memories of past summers are recalled as the team confronts formidable opponents Kenjo, Seinan, and Eishin, striving to finally win the coveted slot in the national tournament. Along the way, various human relationships and emotions intersect, and a key character in TOUCH also joins the scene.[Source: ytv]",

A typical gag involves Shin-chan confounding his parents by using the wrong phrase for the occasion; for example, saying \"Welcome back!\" instead of \"I am back!\" when he comes home.\nDuring the beginning of the series, the TV show was mostly based on the storyline in the original manga. As the show progressed, more and more episodes became anime-original.[Source: Wikipedia]",
